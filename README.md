Hello! My name is Daniil,
I am a programmer and a technical game designer. 

I have experience working with C#, JavaScript, C++ projects. I love to work on game mechanics and game concept building. Technical aspect of the game as well as game mechanics realization is crucial to me.
My passion is game design and mechanical realization in engines.
